They are for all to see. I had done lots of work on them but lost the latest version after failed backup (to gdrive) and linux reinstall.
So I decided to put them on github. As I took a great deal of inspiration from other's files, I might as well give back.

I moved over to tmux for a simple reason, it supports striked text.
